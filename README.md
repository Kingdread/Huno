**Warning: This repository contains Code that could hurt your brain/eyes**

Huno
====
A simple Uno game written in Haskell.

Contains
--------
* lots of bugs
* bad code
* hey, I've written something in Haskell

Installation
------------
Run `cabal build`, the executable will be saved as `./dist/build/Huno/Huno`.
You don't want to install it system-wide, believe me.

Usage
-----
Run the program. You will play against a very basic AI opponent. The computer will ask you for your moves.
Press Crtl+C to escape before you faint.

License

(This abomination doesn't need a license, still:)
